# Issue Category Mapping Rules

## Mapping Strategy
- **Keyword Matching**: Partial/substring matches, case-insensitive
- **Multiple Matches**: Category with most keyword matches wins
- **No Matches**: Leave category column blank
- **Overlapping Keywords**: Flag for manual review


## üèÜ PRIORITY RULES
- **Certificate Priority**: If Certificate category matches AND overlaps/ties with other categories ‚Üí Always assign "Certificate"
- **Bank feeds Priority**: If Bank Feeds category matches AND overlaps/ties with other categories ‚Üí Always assign "Bank Feeds" 
- **Security Priority**: If Security category matches AND overlaps/ties with other categories ‚Üí Always assign "Security"

If Release Effort category has matches AND there's overlap/tie with other categories ‚Üí Always assign "Release Effort"

6. If no matches ‚Üí Leave blank
