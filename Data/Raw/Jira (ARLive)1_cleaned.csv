"Silverfin","18/Aug/25 9:29 PM","25/Aug/25 11:16 AM","","","","Silverin a MYOB partner has reported two main issues during their migration to TPAM via the AccountRight Public API: (1) Only Administrator users can select company files during the consent flow while normal users cannot proceed despite being able to view them and (2) repeated """"API key has exceeded the per-second rate limit"""" errors when using their new client ID. Troubleshooting to date has involved reviews of usage plans, client ID status, consent flow logic, and Apigee/API traffic routing. Slack Convo: [https://myob.slack.com/archives/CU4FWH6CA/p1755474060673489|https://myob.slack.com/archives/CU4FWH6CA/p1755474060673489|smart-link] h4. Issue 1: Consent Flow & Company File Selection * When performing the consent flow, only users with Administrator permissions can select a company file for authorization. * Normal users can see the list of company files but are blocked from selecting them. There is a related message above the dropdown (possibly for security). * This is a change from previous sandbox testing, where normal users could select company files. * Clarification sought on whether this is intentional for all third-party developers, or a configuration/security issue. h4. Issue 2: API Rate Limiting Errors * Partner receives the error: """"API key has exceeded the per-second rate limit"""", even after switching to a new client ID. * The team is unclear if the rate limit error source is Apigee or internal API enforcement. * New client ID provided: {{567a0735-4f8b-4058-a41b-1acc64341f9f}} * Previous client ID (from older dev environment): {{b7ff1ffc-d833-4ecc-a770-87fa5d78ded3}} (not compatible with new consent flow)"

Remediation SLA - Critical Triage SLA : 8 hours (/) | Remediation SLA : 1 day Dependabot uses [WIZ SLAs and Due Dates|https://myobconfluence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/security/pages/8742535904/Dependabot+Usage+Standard]. h3. Summary A critical security vulnerability (CVSS 9.4/10) has been identified in the form-data npm module (v4.0.1), affecting multiple projects in our dependency tree, including business-api-consent-web. The vulnerability arises because form-data uses JavaScript’s Math.random() to generate multipart form boundaries. Since Math.random() is a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) and predictable under certain conditions, an attacker who can observe a sequence of its outputs may infer future values and thus predict the multipart boundary. This opens the door to injection attacks, particularly if the application sends user-controlled input via form-data. The vulnerability maps to CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values. h3. Customer Value Statement Remediating this vulnerability protects confidential customer data, maintains data integrity, and preserves trust in MYOB's platforms. Addressing critical security findings ensures compliance with industry best practices, minimizes exposure to targeted attacks, and demonstrates continued commitment to the security of our customers’ information. ---- h3. Solution * *Upgrade or Patch:* Identify and upgrade all dependencies introducing form-data v4.0.1 (including, but not limited to, @vitest/coverage-v8, axios, cypress, jsdom, and vitest) to a secure version where the vulnerability is addressed. * *Monitor Downstream Fixes:* If a direct update is not yet available in top-level dependencies, monitor upstream projects and contribute/advocate for timely patching. * *Work Around:* As an interim mitigation, avoid sending user-controlled input using form-data when possible, or restrict exposure of Math.random()-generated outputs in server responses to minimize the risk of state prediction by attackers. ---- h3.

Publicly exposed resources are more easily accessible for an attacker than internal ones. The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication and other security mechanisms enforced via middleware by manipulating the {{x-middleware-subrequest}} header. h3. Initial Access The entry point for an attacker is the publicly exposed *hxxps://dev-business-api-consent-web[.]svc[.]platform[.]myobdev[.]com:443/* endpoint, which serves *Next.js* vulnerable to CVE-2025-29927. h3. Execution An attacker can exploit CVE-2025-29927 in *Next.js* by manipulating the {{x-middleware-subrequest}} header to bypass authentication and security mechanisms enforced via middleware. h3. Impact The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to protected resources, potentially compromising the *dev-business-api-consent-web* deployment in the {{ex-cluster-preprod}} subscription. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized actions, or further system compromise. h3. Additional Information CVE-2025-29927 is a critical vulnerability in Next.js versions 14.0.0 to 14.2.24. It has known exploits available and can be remediated by updating to version 14.2.25 or higher. h3. Further info * the issue 'resolves' itself, that's why it is probably not there for you, but I expect that it will appear again. It is suspected that it is caused by the pod being an ephemeral instance. When the resource is gone, Wiz takes that as the issue is resolved and the issue will pop back up when the pod is up again. screenshots before the vulnerability ‘resolves’ itself again !Screenshot (317).png|width=2560,height=1600,alt=""""Screenshot (317).png""""! !Screenshot (316).png|width=2560,height=1600,alt=""""Screenshot (316).png""""!

"Some users cannot access Solo ledgers via the Public-API","07/May/25 10:47 AM","18/Jun/25 5:41 PM","","12/May/25 9:54 AM","","h3. Summary Whilst testing, the Solo team noticed that they were getting an {{Access Denied}} error when using the Public-API with User-Tokens of certain users in the SIT environment, but not others. An investigation was performed, and from this we determined that the issue was being caused by the inclusion of a User check in the Collab-API code. This behaviour was not in the original flow where the Public-API was reading the Collab-DB directly, and a) is not required, b) only detects ARL users and so is breaking the flow for SMEP ledger users and hence c) can/should be removed. h3. Acceptance Criteria # Users of the Public-API should be able to successfully target any ARL or SMEP (e.g. MYOBB, Solo etc) ledgers they are authorised for in Collab when the Collab-API is in use by the Public-API. # Let Nexo know so that they can turn the Collab-API master toggle back on. It is currently off as a workaround for this issue. h3. Testing * There will be a couple of existing Unit and Integration tests that will need to be modified as they will fail once the * Ensure at least 1 E2E test that includes use of the new Collab-API, includes a non-ARL ledger (e.g. MYOBB Pro or similar) *Technical info* Remove the {{ValidateTheUser()}} from the {{MYOB.Huxley.Collaboration.PublicAPIService}} class in Collab (i.e. in the {{Collaboration.sln}} solution) and re-deploy to SIT/Prod.

"[Investigation] Discrepancy between Gateway and Azure Services traffic logs for timed out requests","05/May/25 4:32 PM","28/May/25 4:45 PM","","28/May/25 4:42 PM","","h1. Background All Public API requests from TPAs go through API Gateway and then reach Azure Cloud Service. As a result number of requests reported by Gateway and Service should be very similar, with Gateway latency to be expected slightly bigger due latency between Gateway (AWS) and Service (Azure). In fact, for majority request we can confirm that, where Gateway latency is usually exceeds the Service latency for roughly 10ms. However, I’ve found a significant discrepancy when reported timed out requests in the Gateway and long-running requests in Service. h1. Observation h2. Total Numbers For investigation I used an arbitrary 1-hour timeframe: {{05/05/2025 1:00:00 PM}} to {{05/05/2025 2:00:00 PM}} Gateway reported *3,693* timed out requests ([query|https://service.au.sumologic.com/ui/#/search/create?id=sgWkq1QgbkUZ2krf5cmQBZYuM0xcgC4sorn7XAF0]) in that hour. Service reported *1,426* requests that took more than 59 seconds ([query|https://service.au.sumologic.com/ui/#/search/create?id=Q62xUfgm2lo2TPZc7WxVNUpfx6bDXeHT7IFQKUog]) in the same timeframe. h2. Individual Requests I found two identical requests in Gateway logs to Public API that were called next to each other and were reported very differently by Gateway and Service The request URL: {{PUT https://arl2.api.myob.com/accountright/8a18de5e-88ff-43e8-9d98-b26dde880bc5/Contact/EmployeeStandardPay/78da63db-93ca-460c-9ab1-512519c8dc71}} h3.

Service ([query|https://service.au.sumologic.com/ui/#/search/create?id=MH0rmPjZUWirFqB2em7k4ujgzLGe2qUbguk2caJs]) * Request #1 is missing * Request #2 (1:59:19 PM AEST) returned 200 with 907ms latency h3. Azure Application Insights Logs * App Insight logs contain a single record for a request with latency 911ms (3:59:17 AM UTC), but with {{ItemCount}} of 2, indicating that there were to events, but it it was sampled to record only one log, so it it’s hard to interpret the result. The possible explanation for the second identical request is that client retried the timed out request, so it makes a sense. However a missing log for the 1st request will need to be investigated. h1. Questions # What about other requests? Except the timed out requests are there any other requests that are logged in the gateway but are missing in cloud service logs. # Why are some requests are not logged in the Service? h1.

Root Cause Inside /consent endpoint code logic, we call another Public API endpoint to check the user role (is they need to be an admin). We use s2s token for this call, therefore we don’t need to go via the Gateway URL - [api.myob.com/accountright|http://api.myob.com/accountright] (it’s intended for external clients only).
