# Getting Started - Support Signal Intelligence Engine

## ðŸ“‹ Pre-Development Setup âœ… COMPLETE

Your project is now properly organized with:

### âœ… Folder Structure Created
```
âœ… /Legacy/ - Original Python system preserved
âœ… /Data/ - Organized by Raw/Processed/Config
âœ… /Source/ - Ready for C# development
âœ… /Documentation/ - Project docs location
```

### âœ… Files Organized
```
âœ… dashboard.py â†’ Legacy/
âœ… requirements.txt â†’ Legacy/  
âœ… IssueType.csv â†’ Data/Config/ (categorization rules)
âœ… Jira CSV files â†’ Data/Raw/ and Data/Processed/
```

## ðŸš€ Ready to Start Development!

### Your First Development Prompt:
```
Based on the project context I'll provide, help me begin implementing the Support Signal Intelligence Engine:

1. Create the .NET solution structure in the /Source/ folder
2. Define the core interfaces (ISignalProvider, IStorageService, etc.)
3. Design the SupportSignal and related data models
4. Set up dependency injection configuration
5. Implement the first CSV provider using the categorization rules in /Data/Config/IssueType.csv

Let's start with the foundation and work incrementally. Explain architectural decisions as we build.
```

### Key References:
- **Categorization Rules**: `/Data/Config/IssueType.csv`
- **Sample Data**: `/Data/Processed/Jira_ARLive_categorized.csv`
- **Original Logic**: `/Legacy/dashboard.py` (for reference)

## ðŸ“Š Development Timeline
- **Day 1**: Foundation + CSV + Jira API providers
- **Day 2**: Teams + Reporting + Manual scoring + Demo prep

You're all set! ðŸš€
