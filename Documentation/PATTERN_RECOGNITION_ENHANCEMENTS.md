## Usage Examples

### Setting Up a New Team
```csharp
// Analyze sample data
var learningResult = await patternLearning.LearnPatternsFromSampleDataAsync(
    "team-payments", sampleSignals, existingTeams);

// Get AI suggestions
var suggestions = learningResult.SuggestedCategories;
// [{ CategoryName: "Payment Failures", Confidence: 0.85, Keywords: [...] }]

// Create team with suggestions
var team = new TeamConfiguration
{
    TeamName = "team-payments",
    Categories = selectedSuggestions.Select(s => new CategoryConfiguration
    {
        Name = s.CategoryName,
        Keywords = s.Keywords,
        // ... other properties
    }).ToList()
};
```

### Using Enhanced Categorization
```csharp
var engine = new EnhancedPatternRecognitionEngine(configService, "team-payments");
var result = await engine.CategorizeSignalWithDetailsAsync(signal);

// Result includes:
// - Confidence score: 0.87
// - Reasoning: "Exact: 80%, Fuzzy: 60%, Pattern: 90%, ..."
// - Category probabilities for all categories
```

### Recording Feedback for Learning
```csharp
await learningService.RecordCategorizationFeedbackAsync(
    teamName: "team-payments",
    signal: signal,
    predictedCategory: "Payment API",
    actualCategory: "Payment Gateway",
    confidence: 0.75
);

// System automatically:
// - Updates success rates
// - Identifies improvement opportunities  
// - Suggests new keywords
```

## Configuration Examples

### Enhanced Category Configuration
```json
{
  "name": "Payment Gateway",
  "keywords": ["gateway", "payment", "stripe", "paypal"],
  "priority": 1,
  "patterns": [
    "\\b(gateway|payment)\\s+(error|failed|timeout)\\b",
    "\\bHTTP\\s+[45]\\d\\d\\b"
  ],
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "source": "AI-Generated"
}
```

### ML Integration Settings
