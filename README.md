# Support Signal Intelligence Response Engine

**Innovation Week Project**: "Support Signals, Smarter Decisions: Reducing Toil with AI"
aka 'siren' 

## 🎯 Project Overview
Transform scattered support signals into actionable intelligence and toil reduction opportunities through **Human+AI collaboration**. AI handles the heavy lifting of data aggregation and pattern detection, while humans focus on strategic triage and creative problem-solving.

## 🤖 Human+AI Collaboration Model
**AI Amplifies Human Capabilities:**
- **AI Does**: Automated categorization, pattern detection, trend analysis, data processing
- **Humans Do**: Strategic triage, business context, creative solutions, relationship management  
- **Together**: Transform reactive support into proactive improvement intelligence

## 📁 Project Structure

### `/Legacy/`
Original Python-based dashboard system (reference implementation)
- `dashboard.py` - Streamlit dashboard with basic categorization
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

### `/Data/`
All data files organized by processing stage

#### `/Data/Config/`
- `IssueType.csv` - Categorization rules and keywords (shared by both systems)

#### `/Data/Raw/`
- `Jira (ARLive)1.csv` - Original Jira export
- `Jira (ARLive)1_cleaned.csv` - Cleaned data

#### `/Data/Processed/`
- `Jira_ARLive_categorized.csv` - Categorized output from Python system

### `/Source/`
New C# Support Signal Intelligence Engine (to be created)
- Will contain the .NET solution with plugin architecture

### `/Documentation/`
Project documentation and presentation materials
- Architecture diagrams
- Requirements documentation
- Presentation materials

## 🚀 Development Approach

1. **Phase 1**: CSV Provider (port Python logic to C# plugin architecture)
2. **Phase 2**: Jira API Provider (eliminate manual exports)
3. **Phase 3**: Teams Provider (real-time signal aggregation)

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

- Plugin-based provider system
- JSON-based storage with database migration path
- Multi-timeframe reporting (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- Manual scoring/triage system
- Positive, actionable intelligence generation

## 📊 Business Value - Human+AI Synergy

**🔥 The Problem**: Support teams drowning in manual, repetitive analysis across 8+ disconnected channels

**🤖 AI Solution**: Automated heavy lifting
- Process 1000s of signals in seconds vs. hours of human analysis
- Detect patterns across months of data instantly
- Generate improvement opportunities automatically

**👥 Human Excellence**: Strategic decision-making
- Apply business context AI can't understand
- Make nuanced triage decisions based on relationships
- Create innovative solutions from AI-identified patterns
- Focus on high-value customer relationships

**🚀 Combined Impact**: 
- **70% time savings** on signal analysis (AI automation)
- **40% better prioritization** (human judgment + AI insights)
- **Proactive problem-solving** vs. reactive firefighting

---

**Innovation Day Goal**: Demonstrate how Human+AI collaboration transforms support from cost center to strategic improvement driver.
