# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures and policies for the SIREN Dashboard application.

## Current Security Status

### Resolved Issues
- âœ… **PapaParse Dependency Removed**: Replaced with native CSV utilities to eliminate external dependencies
- âœ… **Native CSV Implementation**: Secure, lightweight CSV parsing and generation without third-party libraries

### Known Issues & Mitigations

#### react-scripts Vulnerabilities
The remaining vulnerabilities are in `react-scripts@5.0.1` development dependencies:

**High Severity:**
- `nth-check` - Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
- `svgo` - CSS selector parsing vulnerability  
- `webpack-dev-server` - Source code exposure vulnerability

**Moderate Severity:**
- `postcss` - Line return parsing error
- `resolve-url-loader` - PostCSS dependency issue

**Risk Assessment:** These vulnerabilities affect **development tools only** and do not impact production builds.

#### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Development Environment Isolation**
   - Development server should only run on localhost
   - Never expose development server to public networks
   - Use production builds for all deployments

2. **Network Security**
   - Development environment behind firewall
   - No external access to webpack-dev-server
   - Use HTTPS in production

3. **Build Process Security**
   - Production builds use `npm run build` which creates static files
   - No vulnerable development dependencies in production bundle
   - Static files served by secure web server (not webpack-dev-server)

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Current Setup)
1. âœ… Remove PapaParse dependency - **COMPLETED**
2. âœ… Implement native CSV utilities - **COMPLETED**
3. ðŸ”„ Ensure development server only runs locally
4. ðŸ”„ Use production builds for deployment

### Long-term (Migration Path)
1. **Migrate to Vite** - Modern, secure build tool with fewer dependencies
2. **Update to React 18+** - Latest security patches
3. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)**
4. **Add security headers**

## Security Best Practices

### Development
- Never run `npm start` on public networks
- Use `npm run build` for production deployments
- Regularly update dependencies with `npm audit`
- Review new dependencies before installation

### Production
- Serve static files from secure web server
- Implement proper HTTPS configuration
- Use security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- Regular security scans of deployed application

### Dependency Management
- Pin dependency versions in package-lock.json
- Regular security audits with `npm audit`
- Evaluate new dependencies for security track record
- Prefer well-maintained packages with active communities

## Incident Response

If a security vulnerability is discovered:

1. **Assess Impact**: Determine if it affects production or development only
2. **Immediate Mitigation**: Implement workarounds if necessary
3. **Update Dependencies**: Apply patches as soon as available
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure fixes don't break functionality
5. **Document**: Update this security policy with lessons learned
